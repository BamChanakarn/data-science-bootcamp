# DataRockie Bootcamp
This data science bootcamp conducted by DataRockie allowed me to embark on a journey of data through hands-on projects and a strong foundation in core principles. The course covered a comprehensive range of topics essential for data analyst role. Here are the key areas I learned from this bootcamp.
### 1. Speadsheets 
  - Filter and sort data, use conditional formatting, mathematical functions, formulas
  - Load, append, transform data using power query tool
  - Generate reports using pivot tables and charts
### 2. SQL and Database
  - In this module, I learned essential SQL codings for cleaning and wrangling data from a database.
  - In [SQL_Homework](https://github.com/BamChanakarn/data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/SQL%20HW), simple database was created as restaurant.db, and I had wrote some queries to explore data.
  - **Skills:** Data queries, Subqueries, Agregate functions, Join tables, Common table expression
### 3. R Programming Language
  - This module introduced fundamental concepts associated with R programming including functions, data types, pipes, etc. 
  - Homeworks for basic R concepts: [Chatbot order pizza](https://github.com/BamChanakarn/data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Pizza_Chatbot) , [Pao Ying Chub game](https://github.com/BamChanakarn/data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Pao%20Ying%20Chub%20game)
  - **Skills:** R, Data Transformation, Data visualization
### 5. Data Visualization
  - Generate visualizations using R and Python
  - Data visulization in R: [Data Visualization of dimond library](https://github.com/BamChanakarn/data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Data%20visualization%20of%20diamonds%20library) demonstrates how I can create graphical summary to discover inslights of the diamond dataset
  - Data visulization in python:
  - **Skills:** R (tidyverse), python
### 6. Statistics for Data Analyst
  - Probability Samplings, distributions, confidenttial interval, p-value, hypothesis testing (AB testing, correlation, regression)
### 7. Machine Learning for Data Analyst
  - Train Test Split, Resampling techniques, 
  - **Skills:** caret library, sklearn library
### 8. Python for Data Analyst
  - This module introduced funcions and methods in python, Control flow, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), apply soup and requests library for web scraping,
  - Project: Answering questions to analyze sales data. [Python final project](https://github.com/BamChanakarn/data-science-bootcamp/blob/main/Python%20final%20project_Sales%20analysis.ipynb)
  - **Skills:* pandas, numpy
